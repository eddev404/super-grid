## Whatâ€™s the Deal with ***Super Grid+***?

***Super Grid+*** is like having a fully loaded game masterâ€™s toolkit right in your browser. Itâ€™s designed to bring your RPG world to life with a digital board, draggable tokens, dice-rolling magic, and more. Whether youâ€™re slaying dragons, exploring haunted dungeons, or just chilling with your party, this app has everything you need to keep the story flowing.

### Core Features That Slay

- **Dynamic Game Board**: A massive 5000x5000-pixel canvas with a 50x50 grid (100px per cell) thatâ€™s perfect for mapping out your world. Zoom in, pan around, and drop a custom map (or choose from presets like parchment or black wood) to set the scene.
- **Tons of Tokens**: Choose from *hundreds* of tokens: heroes, monsters, portraits, and environmental features in normal, large, huge, and gargantuan sizes. Place them on the grid, move them with a click, or zap them away with a right-click. No overlapping chaos here, thanks to smart collision detection!
- **Dice Roller with Flair**: Roll d4, d6, d8, d10, d10%, d12, or d20 with customizable counts and modifiers. Watch the results pop up with a cool spinning animation and hear that satisfying dice-roll sound. Your rolls are logged for easy reference.
- **Mood-Setting Music**: Pick from a curated list of tracks (like "Sky Theme" or "Boss Fight") to keep the atmosphere epic. The audio player loops seamlessly to keep the vibes going.
- **Notes Panel**: Jot down campaign details, NPC secrets, or loot lists in a dedicated textarea. Never lose track of your story!
- **Save & Load**: Save your entire board state â€” tokens, map, music, notes, and dice historyâ€”to local storage or export it as a JSON file. Load it back up anytime to pick up right where you left off.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Go big with a distraction-free fullscreen view. A draggable floating panel keeps all your controls handy without cluttering the board.
- **Responsive Design**: Whether youâ€™re on a desktop or a tablet, ***Super Grid+*** adapts with a mobile-friendly layout thatâ€™s touch-ready and easy to navigate.

## Why Youâ€™ll Love It

***Super Grid+*** is built for both game masters and players who want a smooth, intuitive experience. The dark-themed interface is easy on the eyes, and the controls are snappy â€” zoom with your mouse wheel, pan by dragging, or use arrow keys for precision. Accessibility is on point with ARIA labels and focusable elements, so everyone can join the fun.

The appâ€™s got style, too. Hover effects, smooth transitions, and that dice animation? Pure eye candy (I'm just an apprentice - LMAO). Plus, the ability to upload custom maps and manage tokens of different sizes means you can craft *exactly* the encounter you envision. From a cozy tavern brawl to an epic showdown with a gargantuan dragon, ***Super Grid+*** has your back.

## Getting Started

2. **Choose Your Music**: Select a track to match the mood â€” epic battle or mystical forest, you decide.
3. **Place Tokens**: Browse the collapsible token menus (heroes, monsters, features) and click to add them to the grid. Move or remove them as needed.
4. **Roll Some Dice**: Fire up the dice roller for attacks, skill checks, or random loot drops.
5. **Take Notes**: Keep your campaign details organized in the notes panel.
6. **Save Your Progress**: Export your board state or let it autosave to local storage.
7. **Go Fullscreen**: Maximize the board for a cinematic experience and drag the floating panel wherever you want.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

***Super Grid+*** is already a powerhouse, but Iâ€™m just getting started to make it even more epic! Iâ€™m working on a bunch of exciting features to take your RPG sessions to the next level. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s coming up:

- **Multi-Selection**: Grab and move multiple tokens at once â€” perfect for repositioning your entire party in a flash.
- **Dozens of New Images**: Expand your token collection with tons of fresh heroes, monsters, and features to bring your campaigns to life.
- **Token Rotation**: Rotate tokens for dynamic positioning to match the action on the board.
- **Saved Dice Presets**: Store your favorite dice configurations for quick rolls during intense moments.
